# Lost Ships Replacement - Phantom Crew Revealer

In X4: Foundations, the `Lost Ships Replacement` feature was introduced in version `7.50`.
This feature allows the fleet to request a replacement ship if a ship is lost during the execution of an order. The replacement ship will be requested automatically, and the fleet will continue to execute the order.
However, when you enable the `Lost Ships Replacement` feature for a fleet, the replacement ship will come with only a pilot in place.

At least, only the pilot will be visible in the ship crew information tab.

In reality, there are other crew members on the ship. This extension fixes this issue and reveals these "phantom" crew members on the ship.
